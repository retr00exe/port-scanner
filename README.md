## Port Scanner
I created this this script in order to train my socket programming skill with python xD <br>
This script will scan all open port from port 1 to port 65535. <br>
In the next update I'll add some verbosity and add log feature. <br>

## How To Use
Install dependencies <br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>
Run script <br>
`python3 scanner.py`
